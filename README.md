# Game of Fortunes

Game of Fortunes is a responsive raffle web app for creating games, managing participants, running live draws, and sharing invitations. It uses Angular, Firebase Authentication, and Cloud Firestore, with a NestJS HTTP service for payment and winner-event endpoints.

## App Features

- **Home:** Open the raffle preview, create a game, view plans, download the Android APK, or support the project with the GoTyme QR code.
- **Create a game:** Set the game name, start and close times, ticket length (3–6 characters), random or sequential numbering, draw mode, and participant instructions.
- **Raffle:** Run simultaneous or per-character draws, review raffle details and recent winners, reset a draw, and view spin availability.
- **Participants:** Join with a name, manage participant lists, use the text editor, detect duplicate names, and page through participant entries. Host-entered ticket codes can contain letters and numbers, up to the configured ticket length. Numeric tickets continue to display with leading zeroes.
- **Invitations:** Share a game-specific invitation link or QR code. Invitees can enter a name, optional phone and remarks, and a custom numeric ticket number. Sign-in is required to complete joining; an invitation draft is retained while signing in.
- **History:** Review winners, restore winners who were excluded from the participant list, and view the recent-winner panel. The winner dialog can be dismissed without excluding the winner; exclusion is a separate action.
- **Account:** Sign in with Google or email/password, create an account, edit profile details, and view plan, monthly spins, hosted/joined games, wins, and losses.
- **Plans and payments:** Compare plans and upgrade using PayPal or debit/credit card checkout. Promo and referral codes are available in the checkout dialog. Maya checkout is currently disabled in the web app and marked “Coming soon.”
- **Support:** The Donation page displays the GoTyme QR code for supporting the project.
- **Android:** The Download page provides the current Android APK when a download is available.

## Development

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- Firebase project configuration for authentication, Firestore, and the app's Firebase services

Firebase web configuration and API URLs are defined in `src/environments/environment.ts` and `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`. Local development uses the payment API at `http://localhost:3001`; production uses the configured hosted API. Do not place payment-provider secrets in the Angular app.

### Install and run the web app

```bash
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

The Angular development server defaults to `http://localhost:4200`.

### Build, test, and serve the production build

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm start
```

`npm start` builds the app and serves the generated files with `server.js`. The server defaults to port `8080`, uses the `PORT` environment variable when provided, and exposes `/health` for health checks.

## Android App

The Capacitor app ID is `com.gameoffortunes.app`, with web output in `dist/gofv2/browser`. The Download page links to the published APK when available.

The Android launcher icon source is `assets/icon.png`, a centered machine-mark crop from `src/assets/gofv2logo.png`. After adding or regenerating the Android platform, generate its icon and splash resources with:

```bash
npm run assets:android
```

Then rebuild the debug APK from the `android` directory with `gradlew assembleDebug` (Windows: `gradlew.bat assembleDebug`).
